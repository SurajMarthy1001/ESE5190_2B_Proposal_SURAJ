# Lab 2B Project Proposal

Team: Suraj Sree Balakrishna Marthy and Sai Koushik S S

## Brief Description
We would like to develop a speed controller for a DC motor based on the input from a proximity sensor. The proximity value is sensed and the motor is turned on or off.

## Components Required

- Multicolor LED (or 3 LEDs of different colors)
- Motor
- A few resistors
- Proximity sensor

## Additional Improvements (If time permits, but we hope to complete this too!)

The proximity value is sensed and categorized into three groups:low, medium and high and the speed of the motor (rpm) is adjusted suitably. We would also like to use an LED with different colors to indicate if the motor is running with low, medium or high RPM.

##This is the GIF of the LEDs toggling ON and OFF for a REPL input of 1 or 0 respectively:
